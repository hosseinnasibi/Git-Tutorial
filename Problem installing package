#Problem installing package git-all

I am trying to install git-all using the following commands	

$sudo apt update
$sudo apt install git-all
and I get the following results:	
jonathan@Aristotle:~$ sudo apt install git-all

Setting up runit (2.1.2-3ubuntu1) ...

dpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of git-daemon-run:
 git-daemon-run depends on runit; however:
  Package runit is not configured yet.

No apport report written because the error message indicates its a followup error from a previous failure.

E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)

###The problem exists because runit depends on upstart and Ubuntu changed to using systemd in 16.04 .The workaround is as follows:

$sudo apt-get purge runit
$sudo apt-get purge git-all
$sudo apt-get purge git
$sudo apt-get autoremove
$sudo apt update
$sudo apt install git
Basically you completely get rid of runit, git-all and git, cleanup the apt database and then re-install git. Instead of installing git-all again cherry pick the packages that you actually need and install those.
